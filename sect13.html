<h2 id="one">13.1</h2>
<p>The dictionary table is held in static memory and its byte
   address is stored in the word at <strong>$08</strong> in the header.
</p>

<h2 id="two">13.2</h2>
<p>The table begins with a short header:</p>

<pre>
  n     list of keyboard input codes   entry-length  number-of-entries
 byte  ------n bytes-----------------      byte         2-byte word
</pre>

<p>The keyboard input codes are "word-separators": typically (and under
   Inform mandatorily) these are the ZSCII codes for full stop, comma and
   double-quote.  Note that a space character (32) should never be a
   word-separator.  The "entry length" is the length of each word's
   entry in the dictionary table.  (It must be at least 4 in Versions
   1 to 3, and at least 6 in later Versions.)
</p>

<h2>13.2.1</h2>
<p>Note that the word-separators table can only contain codes
   which are defined in ZSCII for both input and output.
</p>

<h2 id="three">3</h2>
<p>In Versions 1 to 3, each word has an entry in the form</p>

<pre>
   encoded text of word        bytes of data
  ------- 4 bytes ------   (entry length-4) bytes
</pre>

<p>The interpreter ignores the bytes of data (presumably the game's parser will
   use them).  The encoded text contains 6 Z-characters (it is always padded
   out with Z-character 5's to make up 4 bytes: see <strong>S</strong> 3).
   The text may include spaces or other word-separators
   (though, if so, the interpreter will never match any text to the
   dictionary word in question: surprisingly, this can be useful and is
   a trick used in the Inform library).
</p>

<h2 id="four">13.4</h2>
<p>In Versions 4 and later, the encoded text has 6 bytes and
   always contains 9 Z-characters.
</p>

<h2 id="five">13.5</h2>
<p>The word entries follow immediately after the dictionary header
   and must be given in numerical order of the encoded text (when the encoded
   text is regarded as a 32 or 48-bit binary number with most-significant
   byte first).  It must not contain two entries with the same encoded text.
</p>

<h2 id="six">13.6</h2>
<p>Lexical analysis takes place in two circumstances: on request
   of a <strong>tokenise</strong> opcode (in which case it can use any dictionary table
   it likes, in the format above) and during acceptance of a game command
   (in which case the standard dictionary is used).
</p>

<h2>13.6.1</h2>
<p>First, the text is broken up into words.  Spaces divide up
   words and are otherwise ignored.  Word separators also divide words,
   but each one of them is considered a word in its own right.  Thus,
   the erratically-spaced text "fred,go  fishing" is divided into four
   words:
</p>

<pre>
fred / , / go / fishing
</pre>

<h2>13.6.2</h2>
<p>Each word is then encoded as a Z-machine string in
   dictionary form, and searched for in the dictionary.
</p>

<h2>13.6.3</h2>
<p>A "parse table" is then written, recording the number of
   words, the length and position of each word and the dictionary
   address of each word which is recognised.  For the format, see the
   <strong>read</strong> opcode.
</p>
<hr>

<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>Usually (under Inform, mandatorily) there are three bytes of data
   in the word entries, so that dictionary entry lengths are 7 and 9
   in the early and late Z-machine, respectively.
</p>

<p>It is essential that dictionary entries are in numerical order of the
   bytes of encrypted text so that interpreters can search the dictionary
   efficiently (e.g. by a binary-chop algorithm).  Because the letters in
   A0 are in alphabetical order, because the bits are ordered in the right
   way and because the pad character 5 is less than the values for the
   letters, the numerical ordering corresponds to normal English alphabetical
   order for ordinary words.  (For instance "an" comes before
   "anaconda".)
</p>

<p>Both Infocom and Inform-compiled games contain words whose initial
   character is not a letter (for instance, "#record").
</p>

<p>Linards Ticmanis reports that some of Infocom's interpreters convert
   question marks to spaces before lexical analysis.  This is <em>not</em>
   Standard behaviour.  (Thus, typing "What is a grue?" into 'Zork I'
   no longer works: the player must type "What is a grue" instead.)
