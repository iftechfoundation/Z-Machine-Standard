<hr>


<h2 id="one">8.1</h2>
<p>Text may be printed in any font of the interpreter's choice,
   variable- or fixed-pitch: except that when bit 1 of 'Flags 2' in
   the header is set, font 4 has been selected, or when the text style has been set to Fixed Pitch,
   then a fixed-pitch font must be used. The fixed pitch-bit is deprecated in Version 5 and later, 
   and interpreter support in Version 6 is optional.
</p>

<h2>8.1.1</h2>
<p>In Version 5, the height and width of the current
   font (in units (see below)) should be written to bytes <strong>$27</strong> and
   <strong>$26</strong> of the header, respectively.  In Version 6, these bytes
   are the other way round (height in <strong>$27</strong>, width in <strong>$26</strong>).
   The width of a font is defined as the width of its
   '0' character.
</p>
<p>This must be updated whenever the size of the current font changes, for instance if a new 
   window is selected, the current font is changed, or a different style is chosen.
</p>

<h2>8.1.2</h2>
<p>An interpreter should ideally provide 4 fonts, with ID numbers
   as follows:
</p>

<pre>
   1: the normal font
   2: a picture font
   3: a character graphics font
   4: a Courier-style font with fixed pitch
</pre>

<p>(Selecting font ID 0 is legal, and does not change the current font.)
   Ideally all text styles should be available for each font (for instance,
   Courier bold should be obtainable) except that font 3 need only be
   available in Roman and Reverse Video.  Each font should provide characters
   for character codes 32 to 126 (plus character codes for any accented
   characters with codes greater than 127 which are being implemented as single
   accented letters on-screen).
</p>

<h2>8.1.3</h2>
<p><strong>***</strong> A game must not use fonts other than 1 unless allowed
   to by the interpreter: see the <strong>set_font</strong> opcode for how to give
   or refuse permission.  (This paragraph is marked <strong>***</strong> because
   existing Infocom games determined the availability of font 3 for
   'Beyond Zork' in a complicated and unsatisfactory way: see <strong>S</strong> 16.)
</p>

<h2>8.1.3.1</h2>
<p><strong>***</strong>It is legal for a game to change font at any time,
   including halfway through the printing of a word.  (This might be
   needed to introduce exotic foreign accents in the future.)
</p>

<h2>8.1.4</h2>
<p>The specification of the "picture font" is unknown
   (conjecturally, it was intended to provide pictures before Version
   6 was properly developed). 
   Interpreters should not implement it, and should refuse
   permission to any game requesting it.
</p>

<h2>8.1.5</h2>
<p>The specification of the character graphics font is given
   in <strong>S</strong> 16.
</p>

<h2>8.1.5.1</h2>
<p>In Version 5 (only), an interpreter which cannot provide
   the character graphics font should clear bit 3 of 'Flags 2' in the
   header.
</p>

<h2>8.1.6</h2>
<p>Any new fonts will have numbers higher than 4. Fonts 5-1023 are reserved 
   for future Standards to specify. Local use may be made of higher font numbers.
</p>

<h2 id="two">8.2</h2>
<p>In Versions 1 to 3, a status line should be printed by the
   interpreter, as follows.  In Version 3, it must set bit 4 of
   'Flags 1' in the header if it is unable to produce a status line.
</p>

<h2>8.2.1</h2>
<p>In Versions 1 and 2, all games are "score games".  In
   Version 3, if bit 1 of 'Flags 1' is clear then the game is a "score game";
   if it is set, then the game is a "time game".
</p>

<h2>8.2.2</h2>
<p>The short name of the object whose number is in the first global
   variable should be printed on the left hand side of the line.
</p>

<h2>8.2.2.1</h2>
<p>Whenever the status line is being printed the first global
   must contain a valid object number.  (It would be useful if interpreters
   could protect themselves in case the game accidentally violates this
   requirement.)
</p>

<h2>8.2.2.2</h2>
<p>If the object's short name exceeds the available room on
   the status line, the author suggests that an interpreter should break
   it at the last space and append an ellipsis "...".  There is no
   guaranteed maximum length for location names but an interpreter should
   expect names of length up to at least 49 characters.
</p>

<h2>8.2.3</h2>
<p>If there is room, the right hand side of the status line should
   display:
</p>

<h2>8.2.3.1</h2>
<p>For "score games": the score and number of turns, held in
   the values of the second and third global variables respectively.  The
   score may be assumed to be in the range -99 to 999 inclusive, and
   the turn number in the range 0 to 9999.
</p>

<h2>8.2.3.2</h2>
<p>For "time games": the time, in the form <strong>hours:minutes</strong> (held
   in the second and third globals).  The time may be given on a 24-hour clock
   or the number of hours may be reduced modulo 12 (but if so, "AM" or "PM"
   should be appended).  Either way the player should be able to see the
   difference between 4am and 4pm, for example.  The hours global may be
   assumed to be in the range 0 to 23 and the minutes global in the range
   0 to 59.
</p>

<h2>8.2.4</h2>
<p>The status line is updated in exactly two circumstances: when
   a <strong>show_status</strong> opcode is executed, and just before the keyboard is
   read by <strong>read</strong>.  (It is not displayed when the game begins.)
</p>

<h2 id="three">8.3</h2>
<p>Under Versions 5 and later, text printing has a current
   foreground and background colour.  In Version 6, each window has its
   own pair.  (Note that a Version 6 interpreter going under the
   Amiga interpreter number must use the same pair of colours for
   all windows when running Infocom's games.  If either is changed, 
   then the interpreter must change the colour of all text on the screen to match.
   This simulates the Amiga hardware, which used two logical colours
   for text and switched palette to change their physical colour.
   This behaviour should not occur when running non-Infocom games,
   and modern games should never expect it. An interpreter that does
   not wish to handle this behaviour at all should avoid using the
   Amiga interpreter number when running Infocom's Version 6 games.)
</p>

<h2>8.3.1</h2>
<p>The following codes are used to refer to colours:</p>

<pre>
    -1 =  the colour of the pixel under the cursor (if any)
    0  =  the current setting of this colour
    1  =  the default setting of this colour
    2  =  black   3 = red       4 = green    5 = yellow
    6  =  blue    7 = magenta   8 = cyan     9 = white
    10 =  darkish grey (MSDOS interpreter number)
    10 =  light grey   (Amiga interpreter number)
    11 =  medium grey  (ditto)
    12 =  dark grey    (ditto)
</pre>

<p>Colours 10, 11, 12 and -1 are available only in Version 6.</p>

<h2>8.3.2</h2>
<p>If the interpreter cannot produce colours, it should clear
   bit 0 of 'Flags 1' in the header.  In Version 6 it should write
   colours 2 and 9 (black and white), either way round, into the default
   background and foreground colours in bytes <strong>$2c</strong> and <strong>$2d</strong> of the
   header.
</p>

<h2>8.3.3</h2>
<p>If the interpreter can produce colours, it should set bit
   0 of 'Flags 1' in the header, and write its default background
   and foreground colours into bytes <strong>$2c</strong> and <strong>$2d</strong> of the header.
</p>

<h2>8.3.4</h2>
<p>If a game wishes to use colours, it should have bit 6 in
   'Flags 2' set in its story file.  (However, an interpreter should not
   rule out the use of colours just because this has not been done.)
</p>

<h2>8.3.5</h2>
<p>In version 6, if an "under the cursor" colour has been requested by the
   game, then the foreground or background colour shown in window property 11 is
   implementation defined, with two exceptions:
</p>

<h2>8.3.5.1</h2>
<p>If the colour selected was one of the standard set (2-15), then
   that colour is indicated in property 11.
</p>

<h2>8.3.5.2</h2>
<p>If the colour selected was not one of the standard set (this can happen
   when using graphics, which may use many more colours), the colour
   shown in property 11 will be >= 16.
</p>

<h2 id="four">8.4</h2>
<p>The screen should ideally be at least 60 characters wide by 14 lines
   deep.  (Old Apple II interpreters had a 40 character width and some more 
   recent laptop ones have a 9 line height, but implementors should seek to 
   avoid these extremes if possible.)  The interpreter may change the exact
   dimensions whenever it likes but must write the current height (in lines)
   and width (in characters) into bytes <strong>$20</strong> and <strong>$21</strong> 
   in the header.
</p>

<h2>8.4.1</h2>
<p>The interpreter should use the screen height for calculating when to pause 
   and print "[MORE]". 
</p>
<p>In theory, a screen height of 255 lines means "infinite 
   height" (in case, say, the screen is actually a teletype printer), in which 
   case the interpreter should never stop printing for a "[MORE]" prompt. In 
   practice, however, interpreters should avoid setting the height to 255 as it 
   causes serious problems with some Inform and Infocom games. Instead, the 
   interpreter should simply pick a number for the screen height based on a 
   sensible maximum size for screen operations such as <strong>split_window</strong>.
</p>

<h2>8.4.2</h2>
<p>Screen dimensions are measured in notional "units".  In
   Versions 1 to 4, one unit is simply the height or width of one character.
   In Version 5 and later, the interpreter is free to implement units as
   anything from character sizes down to individual pixels.
</p>

<h2>8.4.3</h2>
<p>In Version 5 and later, the screen's width and height in units
   should be written to the words at <strong>$22</strong> and <strong>$24</strong>.
</p>

<h2 id="five">8.5</h2>
<p>The screen model for Versions 1 and 2 is as follows:
</p>

<h2>8.5.1</h2>
<p>The screen can only be printed to (like a teletype) and there
   is no control of the cursor.
</p>

<h2>8.5.2</h2>
<p>At the start of a game, the screen should be cleared and the text
   cursor placed at the bottom left (so that text scrolls upwards as the game
   gets under way).
</p>

<h2 id="six">8.6</h2>
<p>The screen model for Version 3 is as follows:</p>

<h2>8.6.1</h2>
<p>The screen is divided into a lower and an upper window and at any
   given time one of these is selected.  (Initially it is the lower
   window.)  The game uses the <strong>set_window</strong> opcode to select one of the
   two.  Each window has its own cursor position at which text is
   printed.  Operations in the upper window do not move the cursor of the
   lower.  Whenever the upper window is selected, its cursor position is
   reset to the top left.  Selecting, or re-sizing, the upper window does
   not change the screen's appearance.
</p>

<h2>8.6.1.1</h2>
<p>The upper window has variable height (of n lines)
   and the same width as the screen.  This should be displayed on the n lines
   of the screen below the top one (which continues to hold the status line).
   Initially the upper window has
   height 0.  When the lower window is selected, the game can split off
   an upper window of any chosen size by using the <strong>split_window</strong> opcode.
</p>

<h2>8.6.1.1.1</h2>
<p>Printing onto the upper window overlays whatever text is
   already there.
</p>

<h2>8.6.1.1.2</h2>
<p>When a screen split takes place in Version 3, the upper
   window is cleared.
</p>

<h2>8.6.1.2</h2>
<p>An interpreter need not provide the upper window at all.  If
   it is going to do so, it should set bit 5 of 'Flags 1' in the header to
   signal this to the game.  It is only legal for a game to use
   <strong>set_window</strong> or <strong>split_window</strong> if this bit has been set.
</p>

<h2>8.6.1.3</h2>
<p>Following a "restore" of the game, the interpreter should
   automatically collapse the upper window to size 0.
</p>

<h2>8.6.2</h2>
<p>When text reaches the bottom right of the lower window, it
   should be scrolled upwards.  The upper window should never be scrolled:
   it is legal for a character to be printed on the bottom right position
   of the upper window (but the position of the cursor after this operation
   is undefined: the author suggests that it stay put).
</p>

<h2>8.6.3</h2>
<p>At the start of a game, the screen should be cleared and the text
   cursor placed at the bottom left (so that text scrolls upwards as the game
   gets under way).
</p>

<h2 id="seven">8.7</h2>
<p>The screen model for Versions 4 and later, except Version 6,
   is as follows:
</p>

<h2>8.7.1</h2>
<p>Text can be printed in five different styles (modelled on the
   VT100 design of terminal).  These are: Roman (the default), Bold, Italic,
   Reverse Video (usually printed with foreground and background colours
   reversed) and Fixed Pitch.  The specification does not require the
   interpreter to be able to display more than one of these at once (e.g. to
   combine italic and bold), and most interpreters can't.  If the interpreter
   is going to allow certain combinations, then note that changing back to
   Roman should turn off all the text styles currently active.
</p>

<h2>8.7.1.1</h2>
<p>An interpreter need not provide Bold or Italic (even for font 1)
   and is free to interpret them broadly.  (For example, rendering bold-face by
   changing the colour, or rendering italic with underlining.)
</p>

<h2>8.7.1.2</h2>
<p>It is legal to change text style at any point, including in
   the middle of a word being printed.
</p>

<h2>8.7.2</h2>
<p>There are two "windows", called "upper" and "lower": at
   any given time one of these two is selected.  (Initially it is the lower
   window.)  The game uses the <strong>set_window</strong> opcode to select 
   one of the two.  Each window has its own cursor position at which text is
   printed.  Operations in the upper window do not move the cursor of the
   lower.  Whenever the upper window is selected, its cursor position is
   reset to the top left.
</p>

<h2>8.7.2.1</h2>
<p>The upper window has variable height (of n lines) and the
   same width as the screen.  (It is usual for interpreters to print the
   upper window on the top n lines of the screen, overlaying any text
   which is already there, having been printed in the lower window some
   time ago.)  Initially the upper window has height 0.  When the lower
   window is selected, the game can split off an upper window of any
   chosen size by using the <strong>split_window</strong> opcode.
</p>

<h2>8.7.2.1.1</h2>
<p>It is unclear exactly what <strong>split_window</strong> should do if
   the upper window is currently selected.  The author suggests that
   it should work as usual, leaving the cursor where it is if the
   cursor is still inside the new upper window, and otherwise moving
   the cursor back to the top left.  (This is analogous to the Version 6
   practice.)
</p>

<h2>8.7.2.2</h2>
<p>In Version 4, the lower window's cursor is always on
   the bottom screen line.  In Version 5 it can be at any line which is
   not underneath the upper window.  If a split takes place which would
   cause the upper window to swallow the lower window's cursor position,
   the interpreter should move the lower window's cursor down to the
   line just below the upper window's new size.
</p>
<h2>8.7.2.3</h2>
<p>The position of the cursor in the upper window can be set and retrieved 
   with <strong>set_cursor</strong> and <strong>get_cursor</strong>.
</p>

<h2>8.7.2.3.1</h2>
<p>When the upper window is selected, its cursor position can be moved with 
   <strong>set_cursor</strong>. This position is given in units in the 
   form (row, column), with (1,1) at the top left. The opcode has no effect 
   when the lower window is selected. It is illegal to move the cursor outside 
   the current size of the upper window.
</p>

<h2>8.7.2.3.2</h2>
<p>When either the upper or lower windows are selected, <strong>get_cursor</strong>
   returns the position of the cursor (in units) in the upper window.
</p>

<h2>8.7.2.4</h2>
<p>An interpreter should use a fixed-pitch font when printing on
   the upper window.
</p>

<h2>8.7.2.5</h2>
<p>In Versions 3 to 5, text buffering is never active in the
   upper window (even if a game begins printing there without having
   turned it off).
</p>

<h2>8.7.3</h2>
<p>Clearing regions of the screen:</p>

<h2>8.7.3.1</h2>
<p>When text reaches the bottom right of the lower window, it
   should be scrolled upwards.  (When the text style is Reverse Video
   the new blank line should <strong>not</strong> have reversed colours.)  The upper
   window should never be scrolled: it is legal for a character to be
   printed on the bottom right position of the upper window (but the
   position of the cursor after this operation is undefined: the author
   suggests that it stay put).
</p>

<h2>8.7.3.2</h2>
<p>Using the opcode <strong>erase_window</strong>, the specified window
   can be cleared to background colour.  (Even if the text style is Reverse
   Video the new blank space should not have reversed colours.)
</p>

<h2>8.7.3.2.1</h2>
<p>In Versions 5 and later, the cursor for the window being erased
   should be moved to the top left.  In Version 4, the lower window's cursor
   moves to its bottom left, while the upper window's cursor moves to top left.
</p>

<h2>8.7.3.3</h2>
<p>Erasing window -1 clears the whole screen to the
   background colour of the lower screen, collapses the upper window
   to height 0, moves the cursor of the lower screen to bottom
   left (in Version 4) or top left (in Versions 5 and
   later) and selects the lower screen.  The same operation should
   happen at the start of a game.
</p>

<h2>8.7.3.4</h2>
<p>Using <strong>erase_line</strong> in the upper window should erase
   the current line from the cursor position to the right-hand edge,
   clearing it to background colour.  (Even if the text style is
   Reverse Video the new blank space should not have reversed colours.)
</p>

<h2 id="eight">8.8</h2>
<p> The screen model for Version 6 is as follows:</p>

<h2>8.8.1</h2>
<p>The display is an array of pixels.  Coordinates are usually
   given (in units) in the form (y,x), with (1,1) in the top left.
</p>

<h2>8.8.2</h2>
<p>If the interpreter thinks the screen should be redrawn
   (e.g. because a menu window has been clicked over it), it may set bit
   2 of 'Flags 2'.  The game is expected to notice, take action and clear
   the bit.  (However, a more efficient interpreter would handle redraws itself.)
</p>

<h2>8.8.3</h2>
<p>There are eight "windows", numbered 0 to 7.  The code -3
   is used as a window number to mean "the currently selected window".
   This selection can be changed with the <strong>set_window</strong> opcode.
   Windows are invisible and usually lie on top of each other.  All text
   and graphics plotting is always clipped to the current window,
   and anything showing through is plotted onto the screen.
   Subsequent movements of the window do not move what was printed and
   there is no sense in which characters or graphics 'belong' to any
   particular window once printed.  Each window has a position (in units),
   a size (in units), a cursor position within it (in units, relative to its
   own origin), a number of flags called "attributes" and a number
   of variables called "properties".
</p>

<h2>8.8.3.1</h2>
<p>There are four attributes, numbered as follows:</p>

<pre>
    0: wrapping
    1: scrolling
    2: text copied to output stream 2 (the transcript, if selected)
    3: buffered printing
</pre>

<p>Each can be turned on or off, using the <strong>window_style</strong> opcode.</p>

<h2>8.8.3.1.1</h2>
<p>"Wrapping" is the continuation of printed text from
   one line to the next.  Text running up to the right margin will
   continue from the left margin of the following line.  If
   "wrapping" is off then characters will be printed until no more
   can be fitted in without hitting the right margin, at which point
   the cursor will move to the right margin and stay there, so that
   any further text will be ignored.
</p>

<h2>8.8.3.1.2</h2>
<p>"Buffered printing" means that text to be printed
   in the window is temporarily stored in a buffer and only
   flushed onto the screen at intervals convenient for the
   interpreter.
</p>

<h2>8.8.3.1.2.1</h2>
<p>"Buffered printing" has two practical effects:
   firstly it causes a delay before printed text actually appears.
</p>

<h2>8.8.3.1.2.2</h2>
<p>Secondly it affects the way "wrapping" is done.
   If "buffered printing" is on, then text is wrapped after the
   last word which could fit on a line.  If not, then text is
   wrapped after the last character that could fit.
</p>

<p>Example: suppose the text "Here is an abacus" is printed in
   a narrow window.  The appearance (after the buffer has been
   flushed, if there is buffered printing) might be:
</p>

<pre>
                                     |...margins....|
    wrapping on    buffering on       Here is an
                                      abacus^
             off   buffering on       Here is an aba^
             
    wrapping on    buffering off      Here is an aba
                                      cus^
             off   buffering off      Here is an aba^
</pre>

<p>where the caret denotes the final position of the cursor.
   (Games often alter "wrapping": it would normally be on for
   a window holding running text but off for a status-line window,
   which is why window 0 has "wrapping" on by default but all other
   windows have "wrapping" off by default.  On the other hand
   all windows have "buffered printing" on by default and games
   only alter this in rare circumstances to avoid delays in the
   appearance of individual printed characters.)
</p>

<h2>8.8.3.2</h2>
<p>There are 16 properties, numbered as follows:</p>

<pre>
    0  y coordinate    6   left margin size            12  font number
    1  x coordinate    7   right margin size           13  font size
    2  y size          8   newline interrupt routine   14  attributes
    3  x size          9   interrupt countdown         15  line count
    4  y cursor        10  text style
    5  x cursor        11  colour data
</pre>

<p>Each property is a standard Z-machine number and is readable
   with <strong>get_wind_prop</strong> and writeable with <strong>put_wind_prop</strong>.  However,
   a game should only use <strong>put_wind_prop</strong> to set the newline
   interrupt routine, the interrupt countdown and the line count:
   everything else is either set by the interpreter or by
   specialised opcodes (such as <strong>set_font</strong>).
</p>

<h2>8.8.3.2.1</h2>
<p>If a window has character wrapping, then text is
   clipped to stay inside the left and right margins.  After a
   new-line, the cursor moves to the left margin on the next line.
   Margins can be set with <strong>set_margins</strong> but this should only be
   done just after a newline or just after the window has been
   selected.  (These values are margin sizes in pixels, and are by
   default 0.)
</p>

<h2>8.8.3.2.2</h2>
<p>If the interrupt countdown is set to a non-zero value (which by default it 
   is not), then it is decremented on each new-line, and when it hits zero the 
   routine whose packed address is stored in the "newline interrupt routine" 
   property is called before text printing resumes. (This routine may, for 
   example, meddle with margins to roll text around a crinkly-shaped picture.) 
   The interrupt routine should not attempt to print anything.
</p>

<h2>8.8.3.2.2.1</h2>
<p>Because of an Infocom bug, if the interpreter number is
   6 (for MSDOS) and the story file is 'Zork Zero' release 393.890714,
   but in no other case, the interpreter must do the following instead:
   (1) move to the new line, (2) put the cursor at the current left margin,
   (3) call the interrupt routine (if it's time to do so).  This is the least
   bad way to get around a basic inconsistency in existing Infocom
   story files and interpreters.
</p>

<h2>8.8.3.2.2.2</h2>
<p>Note that the <strong>set_margins</strong> opcode, which is often
   used by newline interrupt routines (to adjust the shape of a margin
   as it flows past a picture), automatically moves the cursor if the
   change in margins would leave the cursor outside them.  The effect
   will depend, unfortunately, on which sequence of events above
   takes place.
</p>

<h2>8.8.3.2.3</h2>
<p>The text style is set just as in Version 4, using
   <strong>set_text_style</strong> (which sets that for the current window).  The
   property holds the operand of that instruction (e.g. 4 for italic).
</p>

<h2>8.8.3.2.4</h2>
<p>The foreground colour is stored in the lower byte of the
   colour data property, the background colour in the upper byte.
</p>

<h2>8.8.3.2.5</h2>
<p>The font height (in pixels) is stored in the upper byte of the
   font size property, the font width (in pixels) in the lower byte.
</p>
<p>This must be updated whenever the font size changes, for instance
   because of <strong>set_font</strong> or <strong>set_text_style</strong>.
</p>

<h2>8.8.3.2.6</h2>
<p>The line count is incremented on each new-line, unless it is 
   set to -999. The interpreter should use the line count to see when 
   it should print "[MORE]". A line count of -999 means "never print 
   [MORE]". (Version 6 games often set line counts to manipulate when 
   "[MORE]" is printed.) The line count should never be set to less 
   than -999.
</p>

<h2>8.8.3.2.7</h2>
<p>If an attempt is made by the game to read the cursor position
   at a time when text is held unprinted in a buffer, then this text should
   be flushed first, to ensure that the cursor position is accurate before
   being read.
</p>

<h2>8.8.3.3</h2>
<p>All eight windows begin at (1,1).
   Window 0 occupies the
   whole screen and is initially selected.  Window 1 is as wide as the
   screen but has zero height.  Windows 2 to 7 have zero width and height.
   Window 0 initially has attribute 1 off and 2, 3 and 4 on (scrolling,
   copy to printer transcript, buffering).  Windows 1 to 7 initially have
   attribute 4 (buffering) on, and the other attributes off.
</p>

<h2>8.8.3.4</h2>
<p>A window can be moved with <strong>move_window</strong> and resized with
   <strong>window_size</strong>.  If the window size is reduced so that its cursor lies
   outside it, the cursor should be reset to the left margin on the top
   line.
</p>

<h2>8.8.3.5</h2>
<p>Each window remembers its own cursor position (relative
   to its own coordinates, so that the position (1,1) is at its top
   left).  These can
   be changed using <strong>set_cursor</strong> (and it is legal to move the cursor
   for an unselected window).  It is illegal to move the cursor outside
   the current window.
</p>

<h2>8.8.3.6</h2>
<p>Each window can be scrolled vertically (up or down) any
   number of pixels, using the <strong>scroll_window</strong> opcode.
</p>

<h2>8.8.4</h2>
<p>To some extent windows 0 and 1 mimic the behaviour of the
   lower and upper windows in the Version 4 screen model:
</p>

<h2>8.8.4.1</h2>
<p>The <strong>split_screen</strong> opcode tiles windows 0 and 1 together
   to fill the screen vertically, so that window 1 has the given height and 
   has its y coordinate set to 1, while window 0 is placed just below it
   (with its height suitably shortened, possibly making it disappear
   altogether if the height of window 1 occupies the whole screen).
</p>
<p>The x coordinate and width of the windows are not changed.</p>

<h2>8.8.4.2</h2>
<p>An "unsplit" (that is, a <strong>split_screen 0</strong>) takes place
   when the entire screen is cleared with <strong>erase_window -1</strong>, if a
   "split" has previously occurred (meaning that windows 0 and 1
   have been set up as above).
</p>

<h2>8.8.5</h2>
<p>Screen clearing operations:</p>

<h2>8.8.5.1</h2>
<p>Erasing a picture is like drawing it (see below), except
   that the space where it would appear is painted over with background
   colour instead.
</p>

<h2>8.8.5.2</h2>
<p>The current line can be erased using <strong>erase_line</strong>, either
   all the way to the right margin or by any positive number of pixels in
   that direction.  The space is painted over with background colour
   (even if the current text style is Reverse Video).
</p>

<h2>8.8.5.3</h2>
<p>Each window can be erased using <strong>erase_window</strong>, erasing to
   background colour (even if the current text style is Reverse Video).
</p>

<h2>8.8.5.3.1</h2>
<p>Erasing window number -1 erases the entire screen to
   the background colour of window 0, unsplits windows 0 and 1
   (see <strong>S</strong> 8.7.3.3 above) and selects window 0.
</p>

<h2>8.8.5.3.2</h2>
<p>Erasing window -2 erases the entire screen to the current
   background colour.  (It doesn't perform <strong>erase_window</strong> for all the
   individual windows, and it doesn't change any window attributes or
   cursor positions.)
</p>

<h2>8.8.6</h2>
<p>Pictures may accompany the game.  They are not stored in the
   story file (or the Z-machine) itself, and the interpreter is simply
   expected to know where to find them.
</p>

<h2>8.8.6.1</h2>
<p>Pictures are numbered from 1 upwards (not necessarily
   contiguously).  They can be "drawn" or "erased" (using <strong>draw_picture</strong>
   and <strong>erase_picture</strong>).  Before attempting to do so, a game may ask the
   interpreter about the picture (using <strong>picture_data</strong>): this allows the
   interpreter to signal that the picture in question is unavailable,
   or to specify its height and width.
</p>

<h2>8.8.6.2</h2>
<p>The game may, if it wishes, use the <strong>picture_table</strong> opcode
   to give the interpreter advance warning that a group of pictures will
   soon be needed (for instance, a collection of icons making up a control
   panel).  The interpreter may want to load these pictures off disc and
   into a memory cache.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>See <strong>S</strong> 16 for comment on how 'Beyond Zork' uses fonts.</p>

<p>Some interpreters print the status line when they begin running a Version
   3 game, but this is incorrect.  (It means that a small game printing text
   and then quitting cannot be run unless it includes an object.)  The author's
   preferred status line formats are:
</p>

<pre>
Hall of Mists                                 80/733
Lincoln Memorial                              12:03 PM
</pre>

<p>Thus the score/turns block always fits in 3+1+4=8 characters and the
   time in 2+1+2+1+2=8 characters.  (Games needing more exotic time lines,
   for example, should not be written in Version 3.)
</p>

<p>The only existing Version 3 game to use an upper window is 'Seastalker'
   (for its sonarscope display).
</p>

<p>Some ports of <strong>ITF</strong> apply buffering (i.e. word-wrapping) and scrolling to
   the upper window, with unfortunate consequences.  This is why
   the standard Inform status line is one character short of the width
   of the screen.
</p>

<p>The original Infocom files seldom use <strong>erase_window</strong>, except with window
   -1 (for instance 'Trinity' only uses it in this form).  <strong>ITF</strong> does not
   implement it in any other case.
</p>

<p>The Version 5 re-releases of older games make use of consecutive
   <strong>set_text_style</strong> instructions to attempt to combine boldface reverse video
   (in the hints system).
</p>

<p>None of Infocom's Version 4 or 5 files use <strong>erase_line</strong> at all, and <strong>ITF</strong>
   implements it badly (with unpredictable behaviour in Reverse Video text
   style).  (It's interesting to note that the Version 5 edition of 'Zork I'
   - one of the earliest Version 5 files -- blanks out lines by looking up
   the screen width and printing that many spaces.)
</p>

<p>It's recommended that a Version 5 interpreter always use units to
   correspond to characters: that is, characters occupy $1\times 1$
   units.  'Beyond Zork' was written in the expectation that it could
   be using either 1x1 or 8x8, and contains correct
   code to calculate screen positions whatever units are used.
   (Infocom's Version 5 interpreter for MSDOS could either run in a
   text mode, 1x1, or a graphics mode, 8x8.)
   However, the German translation of 'Zork I' contains incorrect
   code to calculate screen positions unless 1x1 units are
   used.
</p>

<p>Note that a minor bug in <strong>Zip</strong> writes bytes <strong>$22</strong> to <strong>$25</strong> in the
   header as four values, giving the screen dimensions in the form left,
   right, top, bottom: provided units are characters (i.e. provided the
   font width and height are both 1) then since "left" and "top"
   are both 0, this bug has no effect.
</p>

<p>Some details of the known IBM graphics files are given in Paul David
   Doherty's "Infocom Fact Sheet".  See also Mark Howell's program
   "pix2gif", which extracts pictures to GIF files.  (This is one of
   his "Ztools" programs.)
</p>

<p>Although Version 6 graphics files are not specified here, and were
   released in several different formats by Infocom for different computers,
   a consensus seems to have emerged that the MCGA pictures are the ones
   to adopt (files with filenames <strong>*.MG1</strong>).  These are visually identical
   to Amiga pictures (whose format has been deciphered by Mark Knibbs).
   However, some Version 6 story files were tailored to the interpreters
   they would run on, and use the pictures differently according to what
   they expect the pictures to be.  (For instance, an Amiga-intended
   story file will use one big Amiga-format picture where an MSDOS-intended
   story file will use several smaller MCGA ones.)
</p>

<p>The easiest option is to interpret only DOS-intended Version 6 story
   files and only MCGA pictures.  But it may be helpful to examine the
   <strong>Frotz</strong> source code, as <strong>Frotz</strong> implements <strong>draw_picture</strong> and
   <strong>picture_data</strong> so that Amiga and Macintosh forms of Version 6 story
   files can also be used.
</p>

<p>It is generally felt that newly-written graphical games should not
   imitate the old Infocom graphics formats, which are very awkward to
   construct and have been overtaken by technology.  Instead, the 
   <strong>Blorb</strong> proposal for packaging up resources with Z-machine games
   calls for PNG format graphics glued together in a fairly simple way.
   The graphics for Infocom's Version 6 games have been made available in <strong>Blorb</strong>
   format, so that understanding Infocom's picture-sets is no longer very useful.
</p>

<p>The line count of -999 preventing "[MORE]" is a device used by the
   demonstration mode of 'Zork Zero'.
</p>

<p>Interpreter authors are advised that all 8 windows in Version 6 must be
   treated identically. The only ways in which they are distinguished are:
</p>


<ul>
  <li>Different default positions + sizes</li>
  <li>Different default attributes</li>
  <li>@split_window manipulates windows 0 and 1 specifically</li>
  <li>Window 1 is the default mouse window</li>
</ul>


<p>Differences in interpreter behaviour must only arise from differences in
   window attributes and properties.
</p>

<p>In V6, it is legal to position the cursor up against the right or bottom of a
   window - eg at (1,1) in a zero-sized window or at (641,401) in 640x400
   window. Indeed, this is the default state of windows 1 to 7, and the cursor
   may be left at the right-hand side of a window when wrapping is off.
</p>

<p>Attempting to print text (including new-lines) when the cursor is fewer than
   font_height units from the bottom of the window results in undefined
   behaviour - this precludes any printing in windows less than font_height
   units high.
</p>

<p>It is legal for interpreters to always show the same value in property 11 if
   a sampled colour is in use. As a result, story files cannot assume
   that setting a value that was read from property 11 will give the same
   colour, if @set_colour -1 has been used in that window.
</p>

<p>The same rules apply if an interpreter offers non-standard default colours
   although in this case it would be
   ill-advised to show the same colour numbers for foreground and background -
   unless they can be distinguished, non-standard default colours should
   probably not be offered.
</p>

<p>If the interpreter offers a limited palette, then there is no problem, as it
   can be arranged for there to be fewer than 240 distinct non-standard colours.
   In an interpreter with a higher colour-depth, a good implementation would be
   to use colours 16-255 to represent the last 240 distinct non-standard colours
   used, re-using numbers after 240 colours have been used. This will minimize
   potential problems caused by non-standard colours, particularly when set as
   defaults. 
</p>

<p>Regardless of the limitations on colour numbers, in Version 6 each window
   must remember accurately the colour pair selected, so it is preserved across
   window switches.
</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>S</strong> 8.7.2.3 states that it is illegal to move the cursor outside the current
   size of the upper window. <strong>S</strong> 8.8.3.5 gives the equivalent rule for Version 6.
</p>

<p>Many modern games have been lax in obeying this rule; in particular some
   of the standard Inform menu libraries have violated it. Infocom's Sherlock
   also miscalculated the size of the upper window to use for box quotes.
</p>

<p>It is recommended that if the cursor is moved below the split position in
   V4/V5, interpreters should execute an implicit "split_window" to contain the
   requested cursor position, if possible. Diagnostics should be produced, but
   should be suppressable.
</p>


<hr>

<p>Some modern Z-Machine interpeters (mainly those using Andrew Plotkin's 
   Glk interface standard) use slightly non-Standard behaviour for the upper
   window. While this largely causes no problems, Trinity, and many more recent 
   Inform games, print quote boxes using a technique that is not compatible with 
   this implementation.
</p>

<p>Andrew Plotkin has written up some <a href="http://eblong.com/zarf/glk/quote-box.html">notes</a>
   on the issue, including a workaround.
</p>

<hr>

<p>Infocom's Version 6 interpreters and story files disagree on the meaning
   of window attributes 0 and 3 and the opcode <strong>buffer_mode</strong>, in such
   a way that the original specification is hard to deduce from the final
   behaviour.  If we call the three possible ways that text can appear
   "word wrap", "char wrap" and "char clip":
</p>

<pre>
                   |...margins....|
    word wrap       Here is an
                    abacus^
    char wrap       Here is an aba
                    cus^
    char clip       Here is an aba^
</pre>

<p>then Infocom's interpreters behave as follows:</p>

<pre>
                  Apple II      MSDOS         Macintosh   Amiga
A0 off,  A3 off   char clip(LR) char clip()   ---         ---
A0 off,  A3 on    char clip(LR) char clip(LR) ---         ---
A0 on,   A3 off   word wrap     char wrap     ---         ---
A0 on,   A3 on    word wrap     word wrap     ---         ---
buffer_mode off   ---           ---           char wrap   char clip(L)
buffer_mode on    ---           ---           word wrap   word wrap
</pre>

<p>Here "---" means that the interpreter ignores the given state, and
   the presence of L, R or both after "char clip" indicates which of the
   left and right margins are respected.  The Amiga behaviour may be due
   to a bug and two bugs have also been found in the MSDOS implementation.
   Under this standard, the appearance is as follows:
</p>

<pre>
                  Standard
A0 off,  A3 off   char clip(LR)
A0 off,  A3 on    char clip(LR)
A0 on,   A3 off   char wrap
A0 on,   A3 on    word wrap
buffer_mode off   ---
buffer_mode on    ---
</pre>

<p>Due to a bug or an oversight, the V6 story files for all interpreters
   use <strong>buffer_mode</strong> once: to remove buffering while printing
   "Please wait..." with a row of full stops trickling out during a slow
   operation.  Buffering would frustrate this, but fortunately on modern
   computers the operation is no longer slow and so the bug does not
   cause trouble.
