<h2 id="one">6.1</h2>
<p>The "state of play" is defined as the following: the contents
   of dynamic memory; the contents of the stack; the value of the program
   counter (PC), and the "routine call state" (that is, the chain of routines
   which have called each other in sequence, and the values of their local
   variables).  Note that the routine call state, the stack and the PC
   must be stored outside the Z-machine memory map, in the interpreter's
   private memory.
</p>

<h2>6.1.1</h2>
<p> The entire state of play must be stored when the game is saved.</p>

<h2>6.1.1.1</h2>
<p> The format of a saved game file is not specified.</p>

<h2>6.1.1.2</h2>
<p>An internal saved game for "undo" purposes (if there is one) is
   not part of the state of play.  This is important: if a saved game file also
   contained the internal saved game at the time of saving, it would be
   impossible to undo the act of restoration.  It also prevents internal
   saved games from growing larger and larger as they include their
   predecessors.
</p>

<h2>6.1.1.3</h2>
<p>It is illegal to save the game (either with <strong>save</strong> or
   <strong>save_undo</strong>) during an "interrupt routine"
   (one coming about through timed input, sound effect termination or
   newline interrupts).  Therefore saved games need not store information
   capable of restoring such a position.
</p>

<h2>6.1.2</h2>
<p>On a "restore" or "undo" (which restores a game saved into
   internal memory), the entire state of play is written back except that
   'Flags 2' in the header is preserved.  (This information includes whether
   the game is being transcribed to printer and whether a fixed-pitch
   font is being used.)
</p>

<h2>6.1.2.1</h2>
<p>Before a "restore", an interpreter should check that the
   file to be used has been saved from the same game currently being played.
   (See remark below.)
</p>

<h2>6.1.2.2</h2>
<p>After a "restore" or "undo", an interpreter should reset
   the header values marked <strong>Rst</strong> in the header table of <strong>S</strong> 11.  (It should
   not be assumed that the game was saved by the same interpreter.)
</p>

<h2>6.1.3</h2>
<p>A "restart" is similar: the entire state is restored from the
   original story file, and the stack is emptied; but 'Flags 2' is
   preserved; and the interpreter should reset the <strong>Rst</strong> parts of the header.
</p>

<h2>6.1.4</h2>
<p>In Versions 5 and later, an interpreter unable to save the game
   state into internal memory (for "undo" purposes) must clear bit 4 of
   'Flags 2' in the header.
</p>

<h2 id="two">6.2</h2>
<p>Global variables (variable numbers <strong>$10</strong> to <strong>$ff</strong>) are stored
   in a table in the Z-machine's dynamic memory, at a byte address given in
   word 6 of the header.  The table consists of 240 2-byte words and the
   initial values of the global variables are the values initially contained in
   the table.  (It is legal for a program to alter the table's contents
   directly in play, though not for it to change the table's address.)
</p>

<h2 id="three">6.3</h2>
<p>Writing to the stack pointer (variable number <strong>$00</strong>) pushes a
   value onto the stack; reading from it pulls a value off.  Stack entries
   are 2-byte words as usual.
</p>

<h2>6.3.1</h2>
<p>The stack is considered as empty at the start of each routine:
   it is illegal to pull values from it unless values have first been pushed
   on.
</p>

<h2>6.3.2</h2>
<p>The stack is left empty at the end of each routine: when a
   return occurs, any values pushed during the routine are thrown away.
</p>

<h2>6.3.3</h2>
<p>The absolute minimum standard for stack size is defined as:</p>
<p>let the 'usage' of a routine call be 4 plus the number of local
   variables it has.  During a game the total of the usages for each
   routine in the recursive chain of routines being called, plus the
   game's own stack usage, can be assumed to never reach 1024.
</p>

<p>However, more recent games have required a much larger stack
   size than this allows for. It is advised that interpreters allow for these games
   by having a larger stack size if at all possible.
</p>

<p>Two examples of modern interpreters with increased stack size are 
   <strong>Windows Frotz</strong>, with 32768,
   and <strong>nfrotz</strong> with 61440.
</p>


<h2>6.3.4</h2>
<p>In the seven opcodes that take indirect variable references (<strong>inc</strong>,
   <strong>dec</strong>, <strong>inc_chk</strong>, <strong>dec_chk</strong>,
   <strong>load</strong>, <strong>store</strong>, <strong>pull</strong>), 
   an indirect reference to the stack pointer does not push or pull the top 
   item of the stack - it is read or written in place.
</p>

<h2 id="four">6.4</h2>
<p>Routine calls occur in the following circumstances: when one
   of the <strong>call...</strong> opcodes is executed; in Versions 4 and later, when
   timed keyboard input is being monitored; in Versions 5 and later,
   when a sound effect finishes; in Version 6, when the game begins
   (to call the "main" routine); in Version 6, when a "newline
   interrupt" occurs.
</p>

<h2>6.4.1</h2>
<p>A routine call may have any number of arguments, from 0 to
   3 (in Versions 1 to 3) or 0 to 7 (Versions 4 and later).  All
   routines return a value (though sometimes this value is thrown away
   afterward: for example by opcodes in the form <strong>call_vn*</strong>).
</p>

<h2>6.4.2</h2>
<p>Routine calls preserve local variables and the stack
   (except when the return value is stored in a local variable or onto
   the top of the stack).
</p>

<h2>6.4.3</h2>
<p>A routine call to packed address 0 is legal: it does nothing
   and returns false (0).  Otherwise it is illegal to call a packed
   address where no routine is present.
</p>

<h2>6.4.4</h2>
<p>When a routine is called, its local variables are created
   with initial values taken from the routine header (Versions 1 to
   4) or with initial value 0 (Versions 5 and later).  Next, the
   arguments are written into the local variables (argument 1 into
   local 1 and so on).
</p>

<h2>6.4.4.1</h2>
<p>It is legal for there to be more arguments than local
   variables (any spare arguments are thrown away) or for there to
   be fewer.
</p>

<h2>6.4.5</h2>
<p>The return value of a routine can be any Z-machine number.
   Returning 'false' means returning 0; returning 'true' means
   returning 1.
</p>

<h2 id="five">6.5</h2>
<p>A "stack frame" is an index to the routine call state
   (that is, the call-stack of return addresses from routines currently
   running, and values of local variables within them).  This index
   is a Z-machine number.  The interpreter must be able to produce the
   current value and to set a value further down the call-stack than
   the current one, effectively throwing away its recent history
   (see <strong>catch</strong> and <strong>throw</strong>).
</p>

<h2 id="six">6.6</h2>
<p>In Version 6, the Z-machine understands a third kind of stack: a
   "user stack", which is a table of words in dynamic memory.  The first word
   in this table always holds the number of spare slots on the stack (so the
   initial value is the capacity of the stack).  The Z-machine makes no
   check on stack under-flow (i.e., pulling more values than were pushed)
   which would over-run the length of the table if the program allowed it
   to happen.
</p>

<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>Some interpreters store the whole of dynamic memory to disc as part of their
   saved game files, which can make them as much as 45K or so long.  A player
   making a serious attack on a game may end up wasting a whole megabyte, more
   than convenient without a hard disc.  A technique invented by Bryan
   Scattergood, taken up by most modern interpreters, greatly reduces file size
   by only saving bytes of dynamic memory which differ from the initial
   state of the game.
</p>

<p>It is unspecified how an interpreter should decide whether a saved game file
   belongs to the game currently being played.  It is normal to insist that the
   release numbers, serial codes and checksums all match.  The <strong>Pinfocom</strong>
   interpreter deliberately checks only the release number, so that saved games
   can be exchanged between different editions of 'Seastalker' (presumably
   compiled to handle the sonarscope differently).
</p>

<p>These issues are taken up in great detail in Martin Frost's <strong>Quetzal</strong>
   standard for saved game files, created to allow different interpreters
   to exchange saved games.  This Standard doesn't require compliance with
   <strong>Quetzal</strong>, but interpreter writers are urged to consider it: it can only
   help authors if players can send them saved games where bugs seem to
   have appeared.
</p>

<p>The stack is stored in the interpreter's own memory, not anywhere in the
   Z-machine.  The game program has no direct access to the stack memory or
   stack pointer; on some implementations the game's main stack is also used to
   store the routine call state (i.e. the game stack and the call-stack are the
   same) but this need not be true.
</p>

<p>The stack size specification guarantees in particular that if the game
   itself never uses more than 32 stack entries at once then it can have
   a recursive depth of at least 90 routine calls.  The author believes
   that old Infocom games will all run with a stack size of 512 words.
</p>

<p>Note that the "state of play" does not include numerous input/output
   settings (the current window, cursor position, splitness or otherwise,
   which streams are selected, etc.): neither does it include the state
   of the random-number generator.  (Games with elaborate status lines
   must redraw them after a restore has taken place.)
</p>

<p><strong>Zip</strong> provides "undo" but most versions of the <strong>ITF</strong>
   interpreter do not (and <strong>save_undo</strong> returns 0, unfortunately).
   This is probably its greatest
   failing.  Some Infocom-written interpreters will only provide "undo" to a
   game which has bit 4 of 'Flags 2' set: but Inform 5.5 doesn't set this bit,
   so modern interpreters should be more generous.
</p>

<p>Given the existence of Quetzal, a portable saved file format, it is quite
   possible that after loading, the game may be running on a different
   interpreter to that on which the game started. As a result, it is strongly
   advisable for games to recheck any interpreter capabilities (eg Standard version,
   unicode support, etc) after loading.
