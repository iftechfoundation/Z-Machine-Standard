<h1>1. The memory map</h1>

<h2 id="1.1">1.1</h2>
<p>The memory map of the Z-machine is an array of bytes with
   "byte addresses" running from 0 upwards.  This is divided into
   three regions: "dynamic", "static" and "high".  Dynamic
   memory begins from byte address <strong>$00000</strong> and runs up to the byte
   before the byte address stored in the word at <strong>$0e</strong> in the header.
   (Dynamic memory must contain at least 64 bytes.)  Static memory
   follows immediately on.  Its extent is not defined in the header
   (or anywhere else), though it must end by the last byte of the
   story file or by byte address <strong>$0ffff</strong> (whichever is lower).
   High memory begins at the "high memory mark" (the byte address
   stored in the word at <strong>$04</strong> in the header) and continues to the
   end of the story file.  The bottom of high memory may overlap with
   the top of static memory (but not with dynamic memory).
</p>

<h2 id="1.1.1">1.1.1</h2>
<p>Dynamic memory can be read or written to (either directly,
   using <strong>loadb</strong>, <strong>loadw</strong>, <strong>storeb</strong> and <strong>storew</strong>, or indirectly with
   opcodes such as <strong>insert_obj</strong> and <strong>remove_obj</strong>).
</p>

<h2 id="1.1.1.1">1.1.1.1</h2>
<p>By tradition, the first 64 bytes are known as the
   "header".  The contents of this are given later but note that games
   are not permitted to alter many bits inside it.
</p>

<h2 id="1.1.1.2">1.1.1.2</h2>
<p>It is legal for games to alter any of the tables stored
   in dynamic memory above the header, provided they leave the tables
   in legal states.
</p>

<h2 id="1.1.2">1.1.2</h2>
<p>Static memory can be read using the opcodes <strong>loadb</strong> and
   <strong>loadw</strong>.  It is illegal for a game to attempt to write to static
   memory.
</p>

<h2 id="1.1.3">1.1.3</h2>
<p>Except for its (possible) overlap with static memory,
   high memory cannot be directly accessed at all by a
   game program.  It contains routines, which can be called,
   and strings, which can be printed using <strong>print_paddr</strong>.
</p>

<h2 id="1.1.4">1.1.4</h2>
<p>The maximum permitted length of a story file depends
   on the Version, as follows:
</p>

<pre>
    V1-3    V4-5    V6-8
    128K    256K    512K
</pre>


<h2 id="1.2">1.2</h2>
<p>There are three kinds of address in the Z-machine, all of
   which can be stored in a 2-byte number: byte addresses, word
   addresses and packed addresses.
</p>

<h2 id="1.2.1">1.2.1</h2>
<p>A byte address specifies a byte in memory in the range 0
   up to the last byte of static memory.
</p>

<h2 id="1.2.2">1.2.2</h2>
<p>A word address specifies an even address in the bottom
   128K of memory (by giving the address divided by 2).  (Word addresses
   are used only in the abbreviations table.)
</p>

<h2 id="1.2.3">1.2.3</h2>
<p><strong>***</strong>
   A packed address specifies where a routine or string begins
   in high memory.  Given a packed address <em>P</em>, the formula to obtain the
   corresponding byte address <em>B</em> is:
</p>

<pre>
  2P           Versions 1, 2 and 3
  4P           Versions 4 and 5
  4P + 8R_O    Versions 6 and 7, for routine calls
  4P + 8S_O    Versions 6 and 7, for print_paddr
  8P           Version 8
</pre>
   
<p><em>R_O</em> and <em>S_O</em> are the routine and strings offsets
   (specified in the header as words at <strong>$28</strong> and <strong>$2a</strong>,
   respectively).
</p>

<h2 id="1.2.4">1.2.4</h2>
<p><strong>***</strong>
   Throughout the specification, Versions 7 and 8 are identical
   to Version 5 except as stated at <strong>S</strong> 1.1.4 and <strong>S</strong> 
   1.2.3 above, and in the constant used to find the file length, as stated in 
   <strong>S</strong> 11.1.6.

<h2>Remarks</h2>

<p>Inform never compiles any overlap between static and high memory
   (it places all data tables in dynamic memory).  However, many
   Infocom games group tables of static data just above the high
   memory mark, before routines begin; some, such as 'Nord 'n'
   Bert...', interleave static data between routines, so that static
   memory actually overlaps code; and a few, such as 'Seastalker'
   release 15, even contain routines placed below the high memory
   mark.  (The original idea behind the high memory mark was that
   everything below it should be stored in the interpreter's RAM, while
   what was above could reasonably be kept in "virtual memory", i.e.,
   loaded off disc as needed.)
</p>

<p>Note that the total of dynamic plus static memory must not exceed 64K.
   (In fact, 64K minus 2 bytes.)  This is the most serious limitation
   on the Z-machine.
