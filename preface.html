<h1>Preface</h1>

<hr>

<p>The Z-machine was created on a coffee table in Pittsburgh in 1979.  It
   is an imaginary computer whose programs are adventure games, and is
   well-adapted to its task, implementing complex games remarkably compactly. 
   They were still perhaps 100K long, too large for the memory of the home
   computers of their day, and the Z-machine seems to have made the first
   usage of virtual memory on a microcomputer.  Further ahead of its time
   was the ability to efficiently save and restore the entire execution state.
</p>

<p>The design's cardinal principle is that any game is 100% portable to
   different computers: that is, any legal program exactly determines its
   behaviour.  This portability is largely made possible by a willingness to
   constrain maximum as well as minimum levels of performance (for instance,
   dynamic memory allocation is impossible).
</p>

<p>Infocom's catalogue continues to be sold and to be played under
   interpreter programs, either original Infocom ones or more recent and
   generally better freeware ones.  About
   <a href="appf.html">130 story files</a> compiled by Infocom's compiler
   <strong>Zilch</strong> survive and since 1993 very many more story files have
   been created with the Inform design system.
</p>

<p>Eight Versions of the Z-machine exist, and the first byte of any
   "story file" (that is: any Z-machine program) gives the Version number
   it must be interpreted under.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Standardisation</h2>
<p>The majority of opcode names used in this document were agreed between 1994 and 1995
   as a standard set by Mark Howell, author of the disassembler <strong>Txd</strong>
   (part of the <strong>Ztools</strong> suite of utility programs), and Graham Nelson,
   author of the assembly level of Inform.  They do not correspond to
   Infocom's opcode names.
</p>

<p>The first vesion of this Standard was drawn up in November 1995, 
   drawing on a rougher description written in 1993 and, before that, 
   sketches of table formats by Mike Threepoint and others.  It 
   formalised what different interpreter writers regard as the Z-machine,
   guaranteeing a reliable and well-featured platform for writers
   of new games.  The initial 0.2 Standard was followed by the 1.0 Standard,
   which contained mostly corrections and clarifications, but also added some 
   new features.
</p>

<p>This third version of the Standard was initially put together by Kevin Bracey
   and Jason C. Penney and proposed on the Z-Machine Mailing List in December
   2001. After much discussion, and nine drafts, the final list of changes to
   the Standard was uploaded to the if-archive in May 2006. This 2014 document
   adds no new material to that final draft, and is merely a merging of those
   changes to the main Standard.
</p>

<p>The main additions in the 1.1 Standard are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Better colour support, giving games access to 32,768 colours as opposed to 
      the previous 11. Version 6 games may also make use of the new 'transparent'
      background colour.
  </li>
  <li>Version 6 games may now hint to the interpreter that it is safe to make changes
      to the display in a backing store and flush them to the screen later, rather than 
	  making changes directly to the screen. In a program carrying out a complex layered 
	  graphical composition, this may speed up the process.
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>save</strong> and <strong>restore</strong> opcodes have a new optional
      operand that allow the game to control whether the interpreter prompts for a filename
	  or executes the intructions silently.
  </li>
  <li>The optional operand removed from <strong>set_font</strong> in the previous Standard
      has been reinstated.
  </li>
</ul>


<p>There are three companion documents are attached to this Standard.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Quetzal</strong> by Martin Frost, defines a standard
      format for saved-game files, the purpose of which is to allow
      a player to save a game using one interpreter, and then restore
      and continure playing on a new interpreter, or even an entirely
      new machine.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Blorb</strong> by Andrew Plotkin is a standard for a "resources" 
      file to accompany or encapsulate a Z-machine game, neatly packaging up 
	  sound and graphics in modern formats. 
  </li>
  <li><strong>The Treaty of Babel</strong> is a standard for bibliographic 
      information for interactive fiction games. The aim is to provide a unified
      way to identify and describe story files of many different internal formats. 
      The Treaty is not "owned" by any individual, but by a committee of
      representatives from each of the pieces of software which have signed
      up.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Standard interpreters are not <em>required</em> to support these standards, since they
   do not affect Z-Machine behaviour, but interpreter-writers are strongly encouraged to consider it.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>So what is "standard"?</h2>
<p>To call itself "Standard", an interpreter should (as far as anyone knows)
   obey this document exactly for every Version of the Z-machine it claims to
   interpret.  Interpreters need not provide optional features suggested in
   the "remarks" sections, and need not make their source code public.
   Each edition of this document has a Revision number, somewhat like the JFIF
   identification number used by the JPEG standard.  A standard interpreter
   should communicate its revision number in three ways:
</p>


<ul>
  <li>To someone downloading it from the Internet:
      by including it in its filename.
  </li>
  <li>To the player: for instance by means of an "information" option
      on a menu, or in an initialisation sequence.
  </li>
  <li>To the game: by writing it into bytes in the header which were
      always left zero before this standard was devised (see <strong>S</strong>11).  A game
      compiled with Inform library 5/12 or later prints the revision number in its
      banner (if this isn't 0.0).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Few arbitrary choices have been made in writing this document.
   Where Infocom's own shipped interpreters disagree, or contain manifest
   bugs, it has usually been possible to decide which was "correct".
   Elsewhere, minimum levels of performance have been
   invented where necessary.  (For example, a minimum call-stack size
   is needed for programmers to be sure of what level of recursion is safe.)
</p>

<p>Those paragraphs which genuinely extend the Infocom format are
   marked <strong>***[n.m]</strong>, where <strong>n</strong> and <strong>m</strong>
   are the major and minor version numbers for the Standard in which the feature was added.
   In any event, Infocom's original shipped interpreters do
   not conform to this standard document, because of bugs or because of
   slight variations between the Inform output format and Infocom's.
</p>


<hr>

<h2>Notation</h2>

<p>Hexadecimal numbers are written with an initial dollar, as in <strong>$ff</strong>,
   while binary numbers are written with a double-dollar as in <strong>$$11011</strong>,
   according to Inform conventions.  The bits in a byte are numbered 0 to 7,
   0 being the least significant and the top bit, 7, the most.
</p>

<p>Story files are mechanically best identified by their release number
   and serial code, which are written into the header information
   at the bottom of Z-machine memory.  The release number can be anything
   between 0 and 65535 but is usually between 1 and 100.
   The serial code can consist of any six textual characters but is
   usually the date of compilation, arranged <strong>YYMMDD</strong>:
   thus 970619 refers to June 19th, 1997.
</p>

<p>Paul David Doherty, in his extensive investigations into Infocom's
   released games, introduced the notation
</p>

<p><strong>Release number.Serial code</strong></p>

<p>to identify particular story files: for example the first production
   copy of 'Enchanter' is 10.830810.  This notation is used throughout
   the Standard when individual Infocom files need to be referred to.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Where are all the grammar tables?</h2>
<p>The Z-machine has some lexical acuity but it doesn't contain a full parser:
   it's like a computer without an operating system.  A game program has to
   contain its own parser and the tables this uses are not part of the formal
   Z-machine specification.  (Many Infocom games have similar parsing
   table formats simply because, until Version 6, they used an evolving
   version of the 'Zork I' parser.  A quite different parser was used
   in Version 6.)  Inform's parsing table formats are documented in the
   <em>Inform Technical Manual</em>.  For the usual format of Infocom's parsing
   tables, see the <strong>Ztools</strong> utility <strong>Infodump</strong>.

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is an obvious resemblance between an unreadable script
     and a secret code; similar methods can be employed to break
     both.  But the differences must not be overlooked.  The code is
     deliberately designed to baffle the investigator; the script
     is only puzzling by accident.

<p>The Z-machine was originally devised by Joel Berez and Marc Blank in 1979.
   Marc Blank made most of the Version 4 extensions, and Version 5 was created
   by Dave Lebling (with contributions from others including Brian Moriarty,
   Duncan Blanchard and Linde Dynneson).  Version 6 was largely the work of Tim
   Anderson and Dave Lebling.
</p>

<p>In the reverse direction, decipherment is mostly due to the InfoTaskForce
   (David Beazley, George Janczuk, Peter Lisle, Russell Hoare and Chris Tham),
   Matthias Pfaller, Mike Threepoint, Mark Howell, Paul David Doherty and
   Stefan Jokisch.  Only a few of the pieces in the jigsaw were placed by
   myself.
</p>

<p>I gratefully acknowledge the help of Paul David Doherty and Mark Howell, who
   each read drafts of this paper and sent back detailed corrections; also, of
   Stefan Jokisch and Marnix Klooster who have put a great deal of work into
   the fine detail of the specification; and of all those who commented on
   the circulated draft.  Mistakes and misunderstandings remain my own.</p>

<p><em>15 November 1995</em></p>

<p>Kevin Bracey and Stefan Jokisch discovered most of the mistakes in
   Standard 0.2, in developing the first Version 6 interpreters of the
   modern age: <strong>Zip2000</strong> and <strong>Frotz</strong>.  Matthew Russotto
   and Mark Knibbs supplied helpful information about Infocom's own
   Version 6 interpreters.  Stefan also kindly read and commented on
   numerous drafts of the present revision.  Finally, discussion about
   this document was greatly assisted by the Z-Machine Mailing
   List, organised by Marnix Klooster.</p>

<p>The majority of the clarifications and updates in this latest revision are 
   the work of Kevin Bracey and Jason C. Penney. Thanks go also to the members 
   of the (now defunct) Z-Machine Mailing List, and those of the intfiction.org 
   forum, especially Dannii Willis, for bringing to light issues with my initial
   revision. Special thanks to Andrew Plotkin for his notes, advice and general
   help while working on this revised document.

<p><em>21 February 2014</em></p>

<p>The Z-Machine Standard Version 1.1 was the work of Kevin Bracey & Jason C. Penney.
   The initial document went through several drafts before arriving at the finished 
   document, thanks to the comments and advice of the members of the Z-Machine Mailing List.
