<h1>Preface</h1>

<hr>

<p>The Z-machine was created on a coffee table in Pittsburgh in 1979.  It
   is an imaginary computer whose programs are adventure games, and is
   well-adapted to its task, implementing complex games remarkably compactly. 
   They were still perhaps 100K long, too large for the memory of the home
   computers of their day, and the Z-machine seems to have made the first
   usage of virtual memory on a microcomputer.  Further ahead of its time
   was the ability to efficiently save and restore the entire execution state.
</p>

<p>The design's cardinal principle is that any game is 100% portable to
   different computers: that is, any legal program exactly determines its
   behaviour.  This portability is largely made possible by a willingness to
   constrain maximum as well as minimum levels of performance (for instance,
   dynamic memory allocation is impossible).
</p>

<p>Infocom's catalogue continues to be sold and to be played under
   interpreter programs, either original Infocom ones or more recent and
   generally better freeware ones.  About
   <a href="appf.html">130 story files</a> compiled by Infocom's compiler
   <strong>Zilch</strong> survive and since 1993 very many more story files have
   been created with the Inform design system.
</p>

<p>Eight Versions of the Z-machine exist, and the first byte of any
   "story file" (that is: any Z-machine program) gives the Version number
   it must be interpreted under.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="standardisation">Standardisation</h2>
<p>The opcode names used in this document were agreed between 1994 and 1995
   as a standard set by Mark Howell, author of the disassembler <strong>Txd</strong>
   (part of the <strong>Ztools</strong> suite of utility programs), and Graham Nelson,
   author of the assembly level of Inform.  They do not correspond to
   Infocom's unpublished opcode names.
</p>

<p>This Standard was drawn up in November 1995, drawing on a rougher
   description written in 1993 and, before that, sketches of table
   formats by Mike Threepoint and others.  It has formalised
   what different interpreter writers regard as the Z-machine,
   guaranteeing a reliable and well-featured platform for writers
   of new games.  The first formal Standard was numbered 0.2, and
   this is the second, containing some corrections and clarifications
   but also two new features.  The following changes are worth noting:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Support for the Unicode character set has been added,
      introducing a new table and two new opcodes.  <strong>S</strong>3 has been
      rewritten and there are also changes to <strong>S</strong>7 and <strong>S</strong>10, as well
      as the addition of the opcodes to <strong>S</strong>14 and <strong>S</strong>15.
  </li>
  <li><strong>S</strong>8.8.3.1, on window attributes in Version 6, has been
      rewritten with extensive corrections.
  </li>
  <li><strong>S</strong>7.1.2.1.1 requires a new feature: handling nested
      usages of output stream 3.
  </li>
  <li>It is now explicit that text buffering never applies
      to the upper window in Versions 3 to 5.  (In Standard 0.2 the rules
      allowed text buffering in Version 4 under some conditions.)
  </li>
  <li>An optional operand (never used and not useful) has
      been removed from the opcode <strong>set_font</strong>.  An optional operand,
      discovered by Mark Knibbs, has however been added to the Version 6
      form of <strong>set_colour</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>It is now defined that the input character codes for
      return and delete are 13 and 8 respectively.  (10 and 127 have
      been suggested as alternatives in the past).
  </li>
  <li>The fixed-pitch font flag now survives restarts and
      restores, like the transcription flag.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Also, the "character set table" is now called the
   "alphabet table" (for clarity) and the "mouse data table" has
   been renamed the "header extension table."
</p>

<p>A companion document to this one, by Martin Frost, defines a standard
   format called <strong>Quetzal</strong> for saved-game files.  Standard interpreters
   are not <em>required</em> to use <strong>Quetzal</strong>, since choice of saved-game
   format does not affect Z-Machine behaviour, but interpreter-writers
   are strongly encouraged to consider it.
</p>

<p>Andrew Plotkin has created a standard format called <strong>Blorb</strong> 
   for a "resources" file to accompany or encapsulate
   a Z-machine game, neatly packaging up sound and graphics in modern
   formats.  Again, since the Z-Machine has no formal knowledge of the
   means of storage of sound or graphics, interpreters are not required
   to support <strong>Blorb</strong> but as a growing number of games are
   contained in Blorb files, it is highly recommended that interpreters
   support at least basic Blorb capabilities.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="standard">So what is "standard"?</h2>
<p>To call itself "Standard", an interpreter should (as far as anyone knows)
   obey this document exactly for every Version of the Z-machine it claims to
   interpret.  Interpreters need not provide optional features suggested in
   the "remarks" sections, and need not make their source code public.
   Each edition of this document has a Revision number, somewhat like the JFIF
   identification number used by the JPEG standard.  A standard interpreter
   should communicate its revision number in three ways:
</p>


<ul>
  <li>To someone downloading it from the Internet:
      by including it in its filename.
  </li>
  <li>To the player: for instance by means of an "information" option
      on a menu, or in an initialisation sequence.
  </li>
  <li>To the game: by writing it into bytes in the header which were
      always left zero before this standard was devised (see <strong>S</strong>11).  A game
      compiled with Inform library 5/12 or later prints the revision number in its
      banner (if this isn't 0.0).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Few arbitrary choices have been made in writing this document.
   Where Infocom's own shipped interpreters disagree, or contain manifest
   bugs, it has usually been possible to decide which was "correct".
   Elsewhere, minimum levels of performance have been
   invented where necessary.  (For example, a minimum call-stack size
   is needed for programmers to be sure of what level of recursion is safe.)
</p>

<p>Those few paragraphs which genuinely extend the Infocom format are
   marked <strong>***</strong>.  In any event, Infocom's original shipped interpreters do
   not conform to this standard document, because of bugs or because of
   slight variations between the Inform output format and Infocom's.
</p>


<hr>

<h2 id="notation">Notation</h2>

<p>Hexadecimal numbers are written with an initial dollar, as in <strong>$ff</strong>,
   while binary numbers are written with a double-dollar as in <strong>$$11011</strong>,
   according to Inform conventions.  The bits in a byte are numbered 0 to 7,
   0 being the least significant and the top bit, 7, the most.
</p>

<p>Story files are mechanically best identified by their release number
   and serial code, which are written into the header information
   at the bottom of Z-machine memory.  The release number can be anything
   between 0 and 65535 but is usually between 1 and 100.
   The serial code can consist of any six textual characters but is
   usually the date of compilation, arranged <strong>YYMMDD</strong>:
   thus 970619 refers to June 19th, 1997.
</p>

<p>Paul David Doherty, in his extensive investigations into Infocom's
   released games, introduced the notation
</p>

<p><strong>Release number.Serial code</strong></p>

<p>to identify particular story files: for example the first production
   copy of 'Enchanter' is 10.830810.  This notation is used throughout
   the Standard when individual Infocom files need to be referred to.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="grammar">Where are all the grammar tables?</h2>
<p>The Z-machine has some lexical acuity but it doesn't contain a full parser:
   it's like a computer without an operating system.  A game program has to
   contain its own parser and the tables this uses are not part of the formal
   Z-machine specification.  (Many Infocom games have similar parsing
   table formats simply because, until Version 6, they used an evolving
   version of the 'Zork I' parser.  A quite different parser was used
   in Version 6.)  Inform's parsing table formats are documented in the
   <em>Inform Technical Manual</em>.  For the usual format of Infocom's parsing
   tables, see the <strong>Ztools</strong> utility <strong>Infodump</strong>.

  <p>There is an obvious resemblance between an unreadable script
     and a secret code; similar methods can be employed to break
     both.  But the differences must not be overlooked.  The code is
     deliberately designed to baffle the investigator; the script
     is only puzzling by accident.

<p>The Z-machine was originally devised by Joel Berez and Marc Blank in 1979.
   Marc Blank made most of the Version 4 extensions, and Version 5 was created
   by Dave Lebling (with contributions from others including Brian Moriarty,
   Duncan Blanchard and Linde Dynneson).  Version 6 was largely the work of Tim
   Anderson and Dave Lebling.
</p>

<p>In the reverse direction, decipherment is mostly due to the InfoTaskForce
   (David Beazley, George Janczuk, Peter Lisle, Russell Hoare and Chris Tham),
   Matthias Pfaller, Mike Threepoint, Mark Howell, Paul David Doherty and
   Stefan Jokisch.  Only a few of the pieces in the jigsaw were placed by
   myself.
</p>

<p>I gratefully acknowledge the help of Paul David Doherty and Mark Howell, who
   each read drafts of this paper and sent back detailed corrections; also, of
   Stefan Jokisch and Marnix Klooster who have put a great deal of work into
   the fine detail of the specification; and of all those who commented on
   the circulated draft.  Mistakes and misunderstandings remain my own.</p>
<p><em>Graham Nelson</em></p>

<p><em>15 November 1995</em></p>

<p>Kevin Bracey and Stefan Jokisch discovered most of the mistakes in
   Standard 0.2, in developing the first Version 6 interpreters of the
   modern age: <strong>Zip2000</strong> and <strong>Frotz</strong>.  Matthew Russotto
   and Mark Knibbs supplied helpful information about Infocom's own
   Version 6 interpreters.  Stefan also kindly read and commented on
   numerous drafts of the present revision.  Finally, discussion about
   this document was greatly assisted by the Z-Machine Mailing
   List, organised by Marnix Klooster.</p>

<p><em>22 June 1997</em></p>

<p>The majority of the clarifications and updates in this latest revision
   are the work of Kevin Bracey and Jason C. Penney. Thanks go also to the
   members of the (now defunct) Z-Machine Mailing List, and those of the
   intfiction.org forum, especially Dannii Willis, for bringing to light
   issues with my initial revision. Special thanks to Andrew Plotkin
   for his notes, advice and general help while working on this revised document.
