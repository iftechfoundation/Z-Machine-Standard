<h2>Public Interpreters</h2>

<p>Since the 1.0 Standard was first introduced, a variety of 
   <a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXinfocomXinterpreters.html">interpreters</a>
   have become available, for many different platforms and with a variety of features.
   The page on <a href="http://inform7.com/if/interpreters/">Playing Interactive Fiction</a>
   at inform7.com is a good place to start when looking for an interpreter, as is the 
   <a href="http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Z-machine#Assorted_Z-machine_interpreters">ifwiki
   page on the Z-Machine</a>.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Testing compliance</h2>

<p>A few story files exist to test interpreters for various Z-Machine features:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="http://ifarchive.org/if-archive/infocom/interpreters/tools/czech_0_8.zip">Czech</a> 
      is a general Z-Machine unit test by Evin Robertson and Amir Karger.
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://eblong.com/zarf/ftp/praxix.z5">Praxix</a> is a general Z-Machine unit
      test by Andrew Plotkin and Dannii Willis.
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://ifarchive.org/if-archive/infocom/interpreters/tools/etude.tar.Z">TerpEtude</a>
      by Andrew Plotkin is a unit test with a focus on IO.
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://curiousdannii.github.com/if/tests/unicode.z5">Unicode</a> by David Kinder
      tests Unicode input and output.
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://ifarchive.org/if-archive/infocom/interpreters/tools/strictz.z5">Strict Z Test</a>
      by Torbjorn Andersson tests an interpreter's abilitity to handle errors in story files.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Compilers</h2>

<p>Infocom's original compiler <strong>Zilch</strong> no longer exists, but a 
   PDF copy of <a href="http://www.xlisp.org/zil.pdf">Learning ZIL</a>, Infocom's
   documentation for their <strong>ZIL</strong> language, is available. Since
   the emergence of this file, there have been a few attempts at making a new <strong>ZIL</strong> compiler,
   most notably <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/zilf/">ZILF</a> by
   Jesse McGrew.
</p>
<p>No continuous part of the source code of any of Infocom's games is in the public domain [but see
   <a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/infocom/articles/NZT-Zorkhistory.txt">
   Stu Galley's chapter of an Infocom history article</a>, and the IEEE
   article, for fragments].
</p>

<p><strong>Inform</strong> remains the most popular compiler for Z-Machine games. In
   2006, the first public release of <a href="http://inform7.com/">Inform 7</a> was
   made available. <strong>Inform 7</strong> is a very different language from previous versions of Inform,
   with a focus on natural language and a powerful IDE. 
</p>
<p>While <strong>Inform 7</strong> is the main focus of development, <a href="http://inform-fiction.org/">Inform 6</a> is
   still widely used and the compiler and libraries continue to be maintained.
</p>

<p>A few <a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXinfocomXcompilers.html">other compilers</a>
   have been made available over the years.
</p>

<h2>Utility programs</h2>

<p>Mark Howell has written a toolkit of
   <a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXinfocomXtoolsXztools.html">
   Ztools</a>, or utility programs (1991-5, updated 1997), which includes:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Txd</strong>, a disassembler for Versions 1 to 8.  (Uses the
      same opcode names as Inform and this document, and has an option to
      disassemble in Inform assembly-language syntax.)
  </li>

  <li><strong>Infodump</strong>, capable of printing the header information,
      object tree (with properties and attributes), dictionary and grammar
      tables of any Infocom or Inform-compiled game.  (Understands four
      varieties of grammar table: Infocom pre-Version 6, Infocom Version 6,
      Inform GV1 and GV2.)
  </li>

  <li><strong>Pix2gif</strong>, for converting Version 6 picture data
      to GIF files.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Check</strong>, for verifying Infocom or Inform story files.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These continue to be maintained (by Matthew Russotto) and the first two
   are extremely useful. <strong>Infodump</strong> largely supersedes Mike Threepoint's vocabulary
   dumper <strong>Zorkword</strong> (1991-2), which was important in its day (and
   which this author found extremely helpful when writing Inform 1).
</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXinfocomXtoolsXreform.html">Reform</a>,
    by Ben Rudiak-Gould, is a decompiler for Z-Machine games which will attempt to convert them into Inform 6 source code.

<h2>Story files</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Numerous <a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXgamesXzcode.html">
      Inform-compiled story files</a> are publically available.
  </li>
  <li>A few Infocom story files are public, notably two 4-in-1 sample
      games (released for advertising purposes:
      <a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/infocom/demos/sampler1_R55.z3">
      55.850823</a>
      and 
      <a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/infocom/demos/sampler2.z3">
      97.870601</a>) and
      <a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/infocom/demos/minizork.z3">
      Minizork</a> (a heavily
      abbreviated form of Zork I released with a Commodore magazine).
  </li>
  <li>Almost all Infocom's games remain commercially available in
      anthologies published by
      <a href="http://www.activision.com">Activision</a>.
      Copyright resides in them and they should not available by FTP
      from any site.
  </li>
  <li>A few other Infocom story files have existed but are neither
      on sale nor released from copyright: this applies to several of the
      Version 6 games, those games involving literary rights or other
      legal issues ('Shogun', 'Hitch-Hiker's Guide To The Galaxy') and
      ephemera such as beta-test versions (notably the German version
      of 'Zork I') which have somehow passed into private circulation.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Most of the Infocom games exist in
   <a href="appf.html">several different releases</a>, and some
   were written for one Version and then ported to later ones.  'Zork I', for
   instance, has at least 11 releases, 2 early, 8 in Version 3
   (with release numbers between 5 to 88 in chronological order) and one in
   Version 5 (release 52 -- the releases go back to 1 when the version changes).
</p>

<p>Version 1 and 2 games are extinct, though there are a few fossils
   in the hands of collectors.

<h2>Documents</h2>

<p>The definitive guide to all Infocom story files known to exist, and an
   indispensable reference for anyone interested in Infocom, is Paul David
   Doherty's
   <a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/infocom/info/fact-sheet.txt">
   Infocom fact sheet</a>, which is regularly updated, concise and
   precise.  This supersedes Paul Smith's "Infocom Game Information" file.
</p>

<p>Stefan Jokisch has written a
  <a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/infocom/info/sound_format.txt">
  brief specification of Infocom-format sound effects files</a>.
</p>

<p>Martin Frost is the author of the
   <a href="../quetzal/index.html">Quetzal</a>
   standard for saved-game files.  Patches to adapt <strong>Zip</strong>-based
   interpreters to use <strong>Quetzal</strong> are available.
</p>

<p>Andrew Plotkin is the author of the <a href="http://www.eblong.com/zarf/blorb/blorb.html">
   Blorb</a> standard for packaging up images and sounds with Z-machine games.
</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.inform-fiction.org/source/tm/TechMan.txt">
   Inform Technical Manual</a> documents the format of parsing tables
   used in Inform games.
</p>

<p>The documentation for Infocom's games is available online (with permission
   from Activision) courtesy of the <a href="http://infodoc.plover.net/">Infocom
   Documentation Project</a>. In addition, an archive of the 
   "<a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXinfocomXshipped-documentation.html">samplers</a>"
   is publically available, as is 
   <a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXinfocomXarticles.html">
   an interesting historical archive of magazine articles</a> concerning
   Infocom, and articles from Infocom's own publicity magazine
   [indexed
   <a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/infocom/NZT+TSL/NZT+TSL.list">
